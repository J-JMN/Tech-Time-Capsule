> The story of technology is the story of us‚Äîa narrative of innovation, disruption, and human ingenuity. Yet, this history is scattered across countless sources. The Tech Time Capsule is a single, living platform where the pivotal moments of tech history can be discovered, contextualized, and preserved by a community of enthusiasts. It's not just a timeline; it's a collaborative encyclopedia of innovation.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Dynamic Timeline Exploration:** Browse a rich history of pivotal tech moments. Sort the timeline chronologically by **Historical Date** or see what's new by sorting by **Recently Added** events.
* **Precision Filtering:** Instantly filter the entire timeline by a specific category, date, month, or a single/multiple years.
* **Community-Driven Content & Curation:** A secure user account system allows contributors to submit, update, and delete their own events and custom categories.
* **Deep Contextual Links:** Link events to multiple categories with unique "relationship descriptions" that explain the event's specific impact (e.g., "iPhone" -> "Product Launch" -> "Revolutionized the industry").
* **Full Content Details:** Click on any event to see its dedicated detail page, including the contributor, a larger image, and all its assigned categories.
* **Interactive Trivia:** Test your knowledge with a fun trivia game featuring a persistent score saved in your browser.

## üöÄ Live Demo

The application is live at the following URL:

**[‚û°Ô∏è Live Application Link](https://tech-time-capsule-client.onrender.com/)**
### POINT TO NOTE: The deployed project does not feature data fetched from Wikipedia API for financial reasons with render having to access the shell to run my populate command. Although, on the local machine, in the virtual environment in the backend, if you were to run the commands beginning with the term "flask"(i.e "flask populate_db_year 2023 --fast" if you want a quick fetch for the year - it will still take some time but less than it normally would if you ran "flask populate_db_year 2023") it will fetch data for that year and display it in your local environment which is how it should work. You could also fetch data all the way from 2000 to 2024 with this command "./populate.sh" 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Local Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/J-JMN/tech-time-capsule.git](https://github.com/J-JMN/tech-time-capsule.git)
    cd tech-time-capsule
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install Python dependencies
    pipenv install

    # Activate the virtual environment
    pipenv shell

    # Create the database tables from the latest models
    flask db upgrade

    # Seed the database with high-quality sample data
    flask seed_db

    # Run the backend server (it will run on [http://127.0.0.1:5555](http://127.0.0.1:5555))
    flask run -p 5555
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    *Open a new, separate terminal window.*
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root
    cd frontend

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install

    # Run the frontend development server
    npm start
    ```
Your application should now be running locally!
