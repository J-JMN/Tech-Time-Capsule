> The story of technology is the story of us‚Äîa narrative of innovation, disruption, and human ingenuity. Yet, this history is scattered across countless sources. The Tech Time Capsule is a single, living platform where the pivotal moments of tech history can be discovered, contextualized, and preserved by a community of enthusiasts. It's not just a timeline; it's a collaborative encyclopedia of innovation.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Dynamic Timeline Exploration:** Browse a rich history of pivotal tech moments. Sort the timeline chronologically by **Historical Date** or see what's new by sorting by **Recently Added** events.
* **Precision Filtering:** Instantly filter the entire timeline by a specific category, date, month, or a single/multiple years.
* **Community-Driven Content & Curation:** A secure user account system allows contributors to submit, update, and delete their own events and custom categories.
* **Deep Contextual Links:** Link events to multiple categories with unique "relationship descriptions" that explain the event's specific impact (e.g., "iPhone" -> "Product Launch" -> "Revolutionized the industry").
* **Full Content Details:** Click on any event to see its dedicated detail page, including the contributor, a larger image, and all its assigned categories.
* **Interactive Trivia:** Test your knowledge with a fun trivia game featuring a persistent score saved in your browser.
